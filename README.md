# BAVwebsite
A revamp of the old, moldy website for my 55+ community in Florida.  It has a clean, easily readable interface with large fonts for the bifocal crowd.  The front page is essentially an advert for the community, extended by a gallery and a link to the (mockup for now) community rules and regs.  The resident sign-in modal just links to the mockup page for current residents where they would be able to download and print forms, calendars, etc and search the resident directory.  I did this site 100% myself, including the photos/videos and fake logo, so no copyright issues.  I am currently revamping in React instead of Bootstrap.
